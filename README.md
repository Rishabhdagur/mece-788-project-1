# mece-788-project-1
Winter 2021 - MECE 788 Project

We intend to use technical indicators to predict stock prices. Our approach will be two pronged where we use a 
classifier to predict the decision of buy vs sell given the current stock price and past information. 
We will also use evolutionary algorithms to select the features to train our classifier on. We will also do a comparison
of various ml algorithms and their performance.

* If you have just downloaded this repo, please download the data set from:
  https://www.kaggle.com/borismarjanovic/price-volume-data-for-all-us-stocks-etfs
* Extract the data set and place the 'Stocks' Folder inside the data_files folder of this project directory.
* Install conda if you do not have it: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
* Then create a new virtual environment by using the requirement file. You can do this opening your terminal and navi
gating to the project directory. Then using this command: 'conda env create -f environment.yml'
* This will create a new virtual environment, activate it and then use 'jupyter lab' command to open a jupyter session.
* Now you can access the explore_data notebook to view the data.
